# Requirements
 - Python 3
 - 10GB disk storage
 - 2GB free RAM
 - Virtualbox
 - Vagrant (https://www.vagrantup.com)
 - Internet

# How-to
 - Install Virtualbox and Vagrant
 - Clone this repository
`git clone https://github.com/fabrizio-granelli/dncs-lab`
 - You should be able to launch the lab from within the cloned repo folder.
```
cd dncs-lab
[~/dncs-lab] vagrant up
```
Once you launch the vagrant script, it may take a while for the entire topology to become available.
 - Verify the status of the 4 VMs
 ```
 [dncs-lab]$ vagrant status                                                                                                                                                                
Current machine states:

router                    running (virtualbox)
switch                    running (virtualbox)
host-a                    running (virtualbox)
host-b                    running (virtualbox)
```
- Once all the VMs are running verify you can log into all of them:
`vagrant ssh router`
`vagrant ssh switch`
`vagrant ssh host-a`
`vagrant ssh host-b`
`vagrant ssh host-c`

# Assignment
This section describes the assignment, its requirements and the tasks the student has to complete.
The assignment consists in a simple piece of design work that students have to carry out to satisfy the requirements described below.
The assignment deliverable consists of a Github repository containing:
- the code necessary for the infrastructure to be replicated and instantiated
- an updated README.md file where design decisions and experimental results are illustrated
- an updated answers.yml file containing the details of your project

## Design Requirements
- Hosts 1-a and 1-b are in two subnets (*Hosts-A* and *Hosts-B*) that must be able to scale up to respectively 214 and 270 usable addresses
- Host 2-c is in a subnet (*Hub*) that needs to accommodate up to 348 usable addresses
- Host 2-c must run a docker image (dustnic82/nginx-test) which implements a web-server that must be reachable from Host-1-a and Host-1-b
- No dynamic routing can be used
- Routes must be as generic as possible
- The lab setup must be portable and executed just by launching the `vagrant up` command

## Tasks
- Fork the Github repository: https://github.com/fabrizio-granelli/dncs-lab
- Clone the repository
- Run the initiator script (dncs-init). The script generates a custom `answers.yml` file and updates the Readme.md file with specific details automatically generated by the script itself.
  This can be done just once in case the work is being carried out by a group of (<=2) engineers, using the name of the 'squad lead'. 
- Implement the design by integrating the necessary commands into the VM startup scripts (create more if necessary)
- Modify the Vagrantfile (if necessary)
- Document the design by expanding this readme file
- Fill the `answers.yml` file where required (make sure that is committed and pushed to your repository)
- Commit the changes and push to your own repository
- Notify the examiner (fabrizio.granelli@unitn.it) that work is complete specifying the Github repository, First Name, Last Name and Matriculation number. This needs to happen at least 7 days prior an exam registration date.

# Design
- 214 addresses for host-A
- 270 addresses for host-B
- 348 addresses for host-C
- Host-c must run a docker image (dustnic82/nginx-test) this one must be reachable by host-a and host-b
- No dynamic routing can be used
- Routes must be as generic as possible

## Network image
![Image](rete.png)

## Subnetting
- For the network of host-c I have to manage 348 addresses, for this reason I choosen \23 because it can manage a number of addresses equal to (2^9)-2 = 510. In this case I choosen the subnet 192.168.0.0\23.
- For the network of host-b I have to manage 270 addresses, for this reason I choosen \23 because it can manage a number of addresses equal to (2^9)-2 = 510. In this case I choosen the subnet 192.168.2.0\23.
- For the network of host-a I have to manage 214 addresses, for this reason I choosen \24 because it can manage a number of addresses equal to (2^8)-2 = 214. In this case I choosen the subnet 192.168.4.0\23.
- For the network between the two routers I choosen \30 beacuse it can manage a number of addresses equal to (2^2)-2 = 2.

## IP configuration
Since I have two networks attached to the same switch, I must ensure that this switch is able to manage both networks through VLANs and I must create two ports in the router-1 that each work as a gateway, respectively for each network connected to it. The switch port that is connects with the router-1 will be a trunk-port, it will be able to manage the traffic of the VLANs and direct the packets to the router.
```
Router-1       10.1.1.1\30           enp0s9
Router-2       10.1.1.2\30           enp0s9
Router-2       192.168.0.1\23        enp0s8
Host-c         192.168.0.2\23        enp0s8
Router-1       192.168.4.1\24        enp0s8.2
Router-1       192.168.2.1\23        enp0s8.3
Host-a         192.168.4.2\24        enp0s8
Host-b         192.168.2.2\23        enp0s8
```
## Vagrant file
Once the vagrant file has been opened, the first thing to do is change the "path" of each component such as:
```
router1.vm.provision "shell", path: "router-1.sh"
```
Also in the host-c the memory of the device must be increased by passing it from 256 MB to 512 MB in order to put and run the docker-image:
```
vb.memory = 512
```
# Devices configuration

## Switch
In the file `switch.sh` I have to insert lines of code to make sure that the switch ports are added for the different connections, such as adding the broadcast port that connects this device to the router-1. I also need to add the two ports to connect the respective networks of host-a and host-b. The command `sudo ip link set dev ...` will active these ports when I run the `vagrant up` command.
```
export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

apt-get update
apt-get install -y tcpdump
apt-get install -y openvswitch-common openvswitch-switch apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
#Startup commands for switch go here
sudo ovs-vsctl add-br switch
sudo ovs-vsctl add-port switch enp0s8
sudo ovs-vsctl add-port switch enp0s9 tag="2"
sudo ovs-vsctl add-port switch enp0s10 tag="3"
sudo ip link set dev enp0s8 up
sudo ip link set dev enp0s9 up
sudo ip link set dev enp0s10 up
```
## Router-1
In the file `router-1.sh` I have to insert some lines of code to make sure that the router ports are added for the different connections with their respective ip addresses. Furthermore, I must ensure that the port that connects the router with the two underlying networks is divided into two parts to manage both traffic with two different gateway addresses, respectively one for the network connected to host-a and the other for the connection with the host-b. To do this I will use the following commands: `sudo ip link add link enp0s8 name enp0s8.2 type vlan id 2`,` sudo ip link add link enp0s8 name enp0s8.3 type vlan id 3`.
The command `sudo ip link set dev ...` will active these ports when I run the `vagrant up` command. Finally I need to create the static route to be able to reach host-c from host-a and host-b, the command is the following: `sudo ip route add 192.168.0.0/23 via 10.1.1.2` .
```
export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
#Startup commands go here
#Enable routing
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
#Network and VLAN interface config
sudo ip addr add 10.1.1.1/30 dev enp0s9
sudo ip link set dev enp0s9 up
sudo ip link add link enp0s8 name enp0s8.2 type vlan id 2
sudo ip link add link enp0s8 name enp0s8.3 type vlan id 3
sudo ip addr add 192.168.4.1/24 dev enp0s8.2
sudo ip addr add 192.168.2.1/23 dev enp0s8.3
sudo ip link set dev enp0s8 up
sudo ip route add 192.168.0.0/23 via 10.1.1.2
```

## Router-2
In the file `router-2.sh` I have to insert some lines of code to add the router ports for the different connections with their respective ip addresses. The command `sudo ip link set dev ...` will active these ports when I run the `vagrant up` command. Finally I need to create the static route to be able to reach host-a and host-b from host-c, the commands are as follows: `sudo ip route add 192.168.4.0/24 via 10.1.1.1` , `sudo ip route add 192.168.2.0/23 through 10.1.1.1`.
```
export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
#Startup commands go here
#Enable routing
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
sudo ip addr add 10.1.1.2/30 dev enp0s9
sudo ip link set dev enp0s9 up
sudo ip addr add 192.168.0.1/23 dev enp0s8
sudo ip link set dev enp0s8 up
sudo ip route add 192.168.4.0/24 via 10.1.1.1
sudo ip route add 192.168.2.0/23 via 10.1.1.1
```

## Host-a
In the file `host-a.sh` I have to insert the commands to be able to insert the IP, to activate the port connected to the switch and finally to introduce the commands for the static routes, so that the packet targeting another network is sent to the correct router address. The command for this last operation is the following: `sudo ip route add [networkaddress\length] via [routeraddress]`, to be repeated for each network not directly connected to that host.
```
export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
# Startup commands go here
sudo ip addr add 192.168.4.2/24 dev enp0s8
sudo ip link set dev enp0s8 up
sudo ip route add 10.1.1.0/30 via 192.168.4.1
sudo ip route add 192.168.0.0/23 via 192.168.4.1
sudo ip route add 192.168.2.0/23 via 192.168.4.1
```
## Host-b
In the file `host-b.sh` I have to insert the commands to be able to insert the IP, to activate the port connected to the switch and finally to introduce the commands for the static routes, so that the packet targeting another network is sent to the correct router address. The command for this last operation is the following: `sudo ip route add [networkaddress\length] via [routeraddress]`, to be repeated for each network not directly connected to that host.
```
export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
# Startup commands go here
sudo ip addr add 192.168.2.2/23 dev enp0s8
sudo ip link set dev enp0s8 up
sudo ip route add 10.1.1.0/30 via 192.168.2.1
sudo ip route add 192.168.0.0/23 via 192.168.2.1
sudo ip route add 192.168.4.0/24 via 192.168.2.1
```
## Host-c
In the file `host-c.sh` I have to insert the commands to be able to insert the IP, to activate the port connected to the switch and finally to introduce the commands for the static routes, so that the packet targeting another network is sent to the correct router address. The command for this last operation is the following: `sudo ip route add [networkaddress\length] via [routeraddress]`, to be repeated for each network not directly connected to that host. Also on this host I have also added commands to install and run `docker.io` with the related `dustnic82 / nginx-test`.
```
export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
# Startup commands go here
#Network interface config
sudo ip add add 192.168.0.2/23 dev enp0s8
sudo ip link set dev enp0s8 up
sudo ip route add 10.1.1.0/30 via 192.168.0.1
sudo ip route add 192.168.4.0/24 via 192.168.0.1
sudo ip route add 192.168.2.0/23 via 192.168.0.1
#Download package information from all configured sources
sudo apt-get update
#Install and run Docker.io
sudo apt -y install docker.io
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo docker pull dustnic82/nginx-test
sudo docker run --name nginx -p 80:80 -d dustnic82/nginx-test
```
## Conclusion
To see if this works, I need to log into each host with the command `vagrant ssh [hostname]` and try to ping the other hosts with the command `ping [hostaddress]`. Finally I entered into host-a or host-b, I used the command `curl 192.168.0.2` and this was the output:
